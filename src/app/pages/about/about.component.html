          About Pulse Networks
        </h2>
        <p class="text-black">
          Pulses enable people and organisations to make informed decisions that
          improve their business operations and capabilities through real-time,
          real-world observations. At the heart of our organisation lies our
          belief that sensor observations paired with human insights, machine
          learning and Artifical Intelligence can unlock impact, meaning and
          collective intelligence. Enabling people and organisations to access
          this Artificial Intelligence in order to realise their potential is
          key to promote a prosperous future for all.

          Addressing IoT Challenges for Emerging Markets
        </h2>
        <p class="text-black">
          Current IoT solutions are prohibitively expensive and require
          specialist technical knowledge to implement. This is especially true
          for many small to medium scale environmental monitoring applications
          in the energy, water and agricultural sectors. The potential insights
          that could be gained from distributed sensor networks to inform
          decisions related to big national and global challenges such as
          climate change are thus not realised.
